/*
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height). (mass in kg and height in meter).Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variablesCalculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)Create a boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
TEST DATA 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
TEST DATA 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.
GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
